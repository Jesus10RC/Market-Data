# Market-Data
Evaluation of Risk Metrics and Normality Test with Market Data

The following project will be used to:

  * Use Market Data
  * View the Data through Histograms
  * Obtain Stock Risk Metrics
  * Trading with Time Series: DataFrames and obtaining Returns.
  * Perform Normality tests with Assets.

A crucial line of code is the Access `Path` to the DataSet that have been extracted for the different assets to be used.
In this line, we must indicate the route plus the asset that must be dynamic, therefore, a variable is also declared to perform this task `ric`. To finish the line of code we must indicate the format in which the file will be read and, as we can see, the format will be `csv`.
